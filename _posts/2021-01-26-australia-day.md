On my first year in Australia, I was pretty excited when Australia Day came
around and mentioned it to a colleague in passing. Unexpectedly, the colleague
scoffed and said "Bogan Day".

At that time, I did not understand the difference between Australia Day and
Singapore's National Day. Growing up in Singapore, National Day was a big thing.
You see, Singapore was probably the only country that [gain independence against
its will][independent_singapore]. We basically got kicked out of the house when
we were a young nation by our older brother (Malaysia). Forced to survive on our
own, we made it by working damn hard and "punching above our weight".

Every year, come National Day, it was a day for us to be proud of. On that day,
our family will sit down in front of the TV in the evening to watch the National
Day Parade. It starts off with a grand military parade, where we get to show off
our shiny military hardware. It reminds every Singapore male, who is conscripted
into [2 years of mandatory military service][ns], that there is something bigger than
self. It reminds us that 2 years of blood, sweat and toil that each of us gave
means we can stand up on the world stage as an independent country.

I was expecting Australia Day to have the same sort of patriotic, unifying
effect on the Australians. Unfortunately, as I learnt more about it, I realised
how divisive this day is. Much have been said about the hurt to the Aboriginal
community; there's nothing more I can add to this conversation. Two articles
this year especially stood out for me. Firstly, a white Australian perspective
on how [Australia Day didn't mean much to him][1]. Secondly, a fresh take from
Stan Grant on how [changing the date the easy way out][2].

I shy away from personally commenting on issues like this - politics can be
divisive, even when it doesn't have to be. I know that I will never be accepted
as a true Australian (and that is fine), so I don't draw attention, or pretend
my words matter.

But what I'd like to say is how proud I am to be part of this country.
Understand that racism and biases exists in almost every place in the world. For
Australians to be able to acknowledge its existence, to have a conversation
about it, means that we have the ability to change for the better. This, in my
humble opinion, puts us way ahead of other countries. I hope more Australians
will recognise this current debate is actually a strength, and not a weakness.
