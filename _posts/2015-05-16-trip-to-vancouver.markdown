It's off to Vancouver for a week to attend the 2015 OpenStack Summmit!

I'm now typing out this post on the plane to Vancouver, at a atitude of 30000 feet. There's 12 hours ahead of me, so I'm going to start building up this site with jekyll and markdown. The goal is have something pushed out by the time we hand in Vancouver! 

Things to note: Boeing 777-ER has power points on 2/3 of the seats, so if you are preparing to work on the plane make sure you choose a seat with power!

There's no Internet onboard, so I can't be distracted. Time to buckle down, learn jekyll and markdown, and build this site!

Isn't it cool that the first post of this site is a post about building this site on an airplane? :)
